The OpenPLC runtime has a built-in webserver that allows you to configure
OpenPLC and also to upload new programs for it to run. This webserver can be
accessed by opening a web browser on your computer and typing the IP address
of your OpenPLC device at port 8080. For example, if your {{ include.devicename }}
has the IP 192.168.0.103 on your network, you should type this on your browser:

If you don't know the IP address of your board, the Raspberry Pi foundation
has a [nice guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md)
to help you out.

Once you access OpenPLC webserver, you should see in your browser window a
login page like this:

The default username and password is openplc (login) and openplc (password).
This means that the first thing you must do after logging in for the first
time is **change the default username and password**! It is very easy to do
that. Just go to the Users menu, click on the OpenPLC User and change the
information as you like.

Once you save the changes you will be prompted to login again. Just login with
your new credentials and you will be good to go!
