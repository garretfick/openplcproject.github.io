To install OpenPLC type these lines on the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/thiagoralves/OpenPLC_v3.git
cd OpenPLC_v3
./install.sh {{ include.installname }}
```

The installation process will take a while (up to 1 hour depending on your
system). Meanwhile, grab a [insert your favorite beverage here] and relax!
Once OpenPLC is installed, just reboot your device and it will start
automatically after boot.
