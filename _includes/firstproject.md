## My First Project

The [Reference](/reference) menu on this website has a nice tutorial that
teaches you [how to create your first project](/reference-your-first-project).
However, if you're in a hurry, you can download the official Hello World
project, which is basically one rung, a button, a timer and a coil, all
connected together. The button is attached to %IX0.0 and the coil is attached
to %QX0.0. When the button is pressed and released, the coil is energized and
remains on for 2 seconds, and then turns off.
