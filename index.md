## Designed to be Open Source

The OpenPLC is the first fully functional standardized open source PLC, both
in software and in hardware. Our focus is to provide a low cost industrial
solution for automation and research. OpenPLC has been used in
[many research papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2014&q=openplc&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1)
as a framework for industrial cyber security research, given that it is the
only controller to provide the entire source code.

## What is OpenPLC?

OpenPLC is an open-source Programmable Logic Controller (wiki) that is based
on an easy to use software. The OpenPLC project was created in accordance with
the IEC 61131-3 standard, which defines the basic software architecture and
programming languages for PLCs.

OpenPLC is mainly used on industrial and home automation, internet of things
and SCADA research. You can check OpenPLC in action on the short video below.

## OpenPLC Partners

OpenPLC is proud to be partner with FreeWave, the undisputed leader in outdoor
ruggedized radios for military unmanned systems and industrial wireless.
FreeWave's new Industrial IoT (IIoT) programmable radio platform, combined
with the power of OpenPLC, makes Fog Computing, M2M and the Intelligent IIoT a
reality.
